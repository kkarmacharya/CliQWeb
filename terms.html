                      In AsterCliQ we use camera in order to verify our users
                      who are called Cliqtan. The purpose of using camera is to
                      make sure there are no underage as well as fake profiles.
                      This verification process helps us identify fake users and
                      we believe we can provide security to our genuine users by
                      minimizing fake profiles in our app. Once the picture is

                      more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
                      preside over any form of a class or representative

                      attorney general action) unless both you and Aster Dating
                      “CLiQ” specifically agree in writing to do so following
                      initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other
                      Registered Member of Aster Dating “CLiQ” and/or user of
                      Aster Dating “CLiQ” services, can be a class
                      representative, class member, or otherwise participate in

                      Arbitration Agreement, you and Aster Dating “CLiQ” are
                      each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a
                      trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the
                      absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and Aster
                      Dating “CLiQ” might otherwise have had a right or
                      opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge
                      or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case
                      filed in court by others (including class actions). You
                      give up those rights. Other rights that you would have if
                      you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to
                      certain types of discovery, may be more limited in
                      arbitration. The right to appellate review of an
                      arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court,
                      and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be
                      appealed for errors of fact or law.
